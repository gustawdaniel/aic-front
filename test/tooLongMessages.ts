One of them is the HTTP protocol developed at CERN in 1989, which defines the way of transmitting hypertext documents. If we encrypt communication using cryptographic protocols, we get HTTPS. Its advantage is that it is resistant to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nRegarding cryptographic protocols, the currently used protocol is TLS 1.2. It is the successor to the SSL protocol, which Google detected a serious vulnerability to POODLE attack in late 2014. There is also an internet draft of version 1.3 available, which completely eliminates MD5 and RC4, currently considered weak tools, and introduces elliptic curves, which are also used in BitCoins.\n\nThe aim of this post is to show how to install a TLS certificate.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe HTTPS protocol is becoming increasingly popular, largely due to the Let's Encrypt foundation sponsored by EFF, Akamai, Cisco, and Mozilla. It was thanks to them that the certbot program was created, which greatly simplified the certificate acquisition process. Assuming that we have the Ubuntu operating system and an Apache 2 server installed, to install certbot we enter the following commands:\n\napt-get install software-properties-common\nadd-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot\nENTER\napt-get update\napt-get install python-certbot-apache\n\nWe start it with the command:\n\ncertbot --apache\n\nWe provide our email, confirm our agreement with the terms of service with the letter A, answer whether we want to share our email, and choose domains from the list of domains specified in Apache2 configuration. Finally, we select whether we want to enforce HTTPS or only provide it as an option.\n\nRefreshing\n\nAs the certificate expires 90 days after its download, we need a mechanism for its automatic refresh. Fortunately, this is simple. It won't hurt to refresh it more often. Following a third-party trusted guide, we add a command for refreshing the certificate to the crontab.\n\ncrontab -e\n\nAnd we place a line in the file.\n\n45 1 * * 1 /usr/bin/certbot renew >> /var/log/certbot.log\n\nWe can now enjoy the green padlock on our website.\n\nTranslate this text from Polish to English\n\n\"Jeszcze trochę i kończę pracę.\"\n\n\"In a little while and I'll finish work.\"\n\nSources:\n\nCertbot installation\n\nhttps://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuxenial-apache\n\nDifferences between SSL and TLS\n\n\n\nSSL versus TLS – What’s the Difference?\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are both protocols designed to provide secure communications over a network. SSL was originally developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s, and TLS is its successor. While the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably, there are some significant differences between the two.\n\nEncryption Algorithm\n\nOne of the most significant differences between SSL and TLS is the encryption algorithm they use. SSL uses the RSA algorithm for key exchange and message encryption, while TLS can use several different algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).\n\nAuthentication Protocols\n\nSSL and TLS also have different authentication protocols. SSL uses a specific authentication protocol called Client Authentication Protocol (CAP), while TLS uses a more flexible protocol called Server Authentication Protocol (SAP). The SAP allows the server to authenticate itself to the client, while the CAP only allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.\n\nVersions\n\nSSL and TLS also have different versions. SSL has four versions, SSL 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, and TLS 1.0. TLS has four versions as well, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. SSL 1.0 and SSL 2.0 are considered obsolete and insecure, and are no longer supported by most web browsers.\n\nSecurity\n\nFinally, TLS is considered to be more secure than SSL. This is partly due to the fact that TLS supports stronger encryption algorithms than SSL, such as ECC. Additionally, vulnerabilities have been discovered in both SSL and TLS, but the vulnerabilities in SSL are generally considered to be more serious.\n\nConclusion\n\nSSL and TLS are both important protocols for securing communications over a network. While SSL is older and less secure than TLS, it is still widely used. However, it is recommended that organizations use TLS whenever possible to ensure the highest level of security.\n\nPOODLE Attack\n\nPlease refer to this website for a detailed explanation of the POODLE attack and the deprecation of SSL 3.0 by Mozilla.\n\nGuide from a trusted third party.\n\n\"How to Implement Automatic Renewal of Free SSL Certificates from Let's Encrypt\"\n\nUsage statistics of https\n\nhttps://www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/metrics/?hl=en"

As a protocol, it allows for the exchange of information between different devices and servers, making it possible for users to access websites, email, and other online content. However, because HTTP is not secure on its own, a newer protocol known as HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, has emerged as a more secure replacement for HTTP. HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between users and servers, making it significantly more difficult for hackers and other malicious parties to intercept and steal sensitive information. While HTTPS is now the standard for most internet communications, some websites still use HTTP, making it a potential security risk for users who share personal information online."

SSL was originally developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s, and TLS is its successor. While the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably, there are some significant differences between the two.\n\nEncryption Algorithm\n\nOne of the most significant differences between SSL and TLS is the encryption algorithm they use. SSL uses the RSA algorithm for key exchange and message encryption, while TLS can use several different algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).\n\nAuthentication Protocols\n\nSSL and TLS also have different authentication protocols. SSL uses a specific authentication protocol called Client Authentication Protocol (CAP), while TLS uses a more flexible protocol called Server Authentication Protocol (SAP). The SAP allows the server to authenticate itself to the client, while the CAP only allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.\n\nVersions\n\nSSL and TLS also have different versions. SSL has four versions, SSL 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, and TLS 1.0. TLS has four versions as well, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. SSL 1.0 and SSL 2.0 are considered obsolete and insecure, and are no longer supported by most web browsers.\n\nSecurity\n\nFinally, TLS is considered to be more secure than SSL. This is partly due to the fact that TLS supports stronger encryption algorithms than SSL, such as ECC. Additionally, vulnerabilities have been discovered in both SSL and TLS, but the vulnerabilities in SSL are generally considered to be more serious.\n\nConclusion\n\nSSL and TLS are both important protocols for securing communications over a network. While SSL is older and less secure than TLS, it is still widely used. However, it is recommended that organizations use TLS whenever possible to ensure the highest level of security.\n\nPOODLE Attack\n\nPlease refer to this website for a detailed explanation of the POODLE attack and the deprecation of SSL 3.0 by Mozilla.\n\nGuide from a trusted third party.\n\n\"How to Implement Automatic Renewal of Free SSL Certificates from Let's Encrypt\"\n\nUsage statistics of https\n\nhttps://www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/metrics/?hl=en"

The SAP allows the server to authenticate itself to the client, while the CAP only allows the client to authenticate itself to the server.\n\nVersions\n\nSSL and TLS also have different versions. SSL has four versions, SSL 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, and TLS 1.0. TLS has four versions as well, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. SSL 1.0 and SSL 2.0 are considered obsolete and insecure, and are no longer supported by most web browsers.\n\nSecurity\n\nFinally, TLS is considered to be more secure than SSL. This is partly due to the fact that TLS supports stronger encryption algorithms than SSL, such as ECC. Additionally, vulnerabilities have been discovered in both SSL and TLS, but the vulnerabilities in SSL are generally considered to be more serious.\n\nConclusion\n\nSSL and TLS are both important protocols for securing communications over a network. While SSL is older and less secure than TLS, it is still widely used.

One of them is the HTTP protocol developed at CERN in 1989, which defines the way of transmitting hypertext documents. If we encrypt communication using cryptographic protocols, we get HTTPS. Its advantage is that it is resistant to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nRegarding cryptographic protocols, the currently used protocol is TLS 1.2. It is the successor to the SSL protocol, which Google detected a serious vulnerability to POODLE attack in late 2014. There is also an internet draft of version 1.3 available, which completely eliminates MD5 and RC4, currently considered weak tools, and introduces elliptic curves, which are also used in BitCoins.\n\nThe aim of this post is to show how to install a TLS certificate.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe HTTPS protocol is becoming increasingly popular, largely due to the Let's Encrypt foundation sponsored by EFF, Akamai, Cisco, and Mozilla. It was thanks to them that the certbot program was created, which greatly simplified the certificate acquisition process. Assuming that we have the Ubuntu operating system and an Apache 2 server installed, to install certbot we enter the following commands:\n\napt-get install software-properties-common\nadd-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot\nENTER\napt-get update\napt-get install python-certbot-apache\n\nWe start it with the command:\n\ncertbot --apache\n\nWe provide our email, confirm our agreement with the terms of service with the letter A, answer whether we want to share our email, and choose domains from the list of domains specified in Apache2 configuration. Finally, we select whether we want to enforce HTTPS or only provide it as an option.\n\nRefreshing\n\nAs the certificate expires 90 days after its download, we need a mechanism for its automatic refresh. Fortunately, this is simple. It won't hurt to refresh it more often. Following a third-party trusted guide, we add a command for refreshing the certificate to the crontab.\n\ncrontab -e\n\nAnd we place a line in the file.\n\n45 1 * * 1 /usr/bin/certbot renew >> /var/log/certbot.log\n\nWe can now enjoy the green padlock on our website.\n\nTranslate this text from Polish to English\n\n\"Jeszcze trochę i kończę pracę.\"\n\n\"In a little while and I'll finish work.\"\n\nSources:\n\nCertbot installation\n\nhttps://certbot.eff.org/#ubuntuxenial-apache\n\nDifferences between SSL and TLS\n\n\n\nSSL versus TLS – What’s the Difference?\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are both protocols designed to provide secure communications over a network. SSL was originally developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s, and TLS is its successor. While the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably, there are some significant differences between the two.\n\nEncryption Algorithm\n\nOne of the most significant differences between SSL and TLS is the encryption algorithm they use. SSL uses the RSA algorithm for key exchange and message encryption, while TLS can use several different algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).\n\nAuthentication Protocols\n\nSSL and TLS also have different authentication protocols.

As a protocol, it allows for the exchange of information between different devices and servers, making it possible for users to access websites, email, and other online content. However, because HTTP is not secure on its own, a newer protocol known as HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, has emerged as a more secure replacement for HTTP. HTTPS encrypts data exchanged between users and servers, making it significantly more difficult for hackers and other malicious parties to intercept and steal sensitive information. While HTTPS is now the standard for most internet communications, some websites still use HTTP, making it a potential security risk for users who share personal information online.\n\nCryptographic protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), play a vital role in the security of modern communication over the internet. TLS is used in various applications such as web browsing, email, and file transfer, to name a few. TLS version 1.2, released in 2008, is an encryption protocol that has been widely used for secure data transmission over the internet. Despite its widespread use, however, it has some weaknesses against newer cryptographic attacks. As a result, a new version of the TLS protocol, TLS 1.3, was developed and released in 2018 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). TLS 1.3 has significant improvements over its predecessor, including better performance and enhanced security features. One key feature of TLS 1.3 is the removal of support for older cryptographic algorithms such as RC4, MD5, and SHA-1, which are now considered vulnerable to attacks. TLS 1.3 also includes support for new encryption algorithms such as ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which are faster and more secure than older algorithms. The adoption of newer cryptographic protocols such as TLS 1.3 is crucial in ensuring the security and privacy of communication in the digital age.\n\nHTTPS has become the standard protocol for transmitting data over the internet due to its secure and robust nature. This has led to the rise of certbot, the free, automated, and open-source software from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) that facilitates the installation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. The TLS certificates, issued by third-party authorities, encrypt data transmissions and protect against security breaches that undermine the confidentiality and integrity of online communication. This post will explain how to use certbot to deploy TLS certificates on Ubuntu using the Apache web server. The guide will outline an efficient process for installing certbot and acquiring your TLS certificates through a series of command line entries.\n\nWhen we install an SSL/TLS certificate on our website, it's important to remember that the certificate has an expiration date. The Let's Encrypt foundation, which sponsors EFF, Akamai, Cisco, and Mozilla, offers free SSL/TLS certificates with a lifespan of 90 days. While this may seem like a hassle, it's important in order to maintain a high level of security on our websites. To ensure that our SSL/TLS certificates remain up-to-date, there's a command that we can use to automatically refresh them via the crontab on our server. This means that the certificate renewal process will take place automatically, and we won't have to constantly worry about renewing our certificates manually. Using this command is an easy and efficient way to keep our websites secure and up-to-date, without us having to constantly monitor and renew our SSL/TLS certificates.\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are both cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communications over a network. While SSL was originally developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s, TLS is its successor. Although the terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably, they have significant differences in encryption algorithm, authentication protocols, versions, and security. SSL uses the RSA algorithm for key exchange and message encryption, while TLS can use several different algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Moreover, SSL and TLS have different authentication protocols. SSL uses a specific authentication protocol called Client Authentication Protocol (CAP), while TLS uses a more flexible protocol called Server Authentication Protocol (SAP). Additionally, SSL and TLS have different versions, and TLS is considered to be more secure than SSL because of its stronger encryption algorithms, such as ECC. Finally, vulnerabilities have been discovered in both SSL and TLS, but the vulnerabilities in SSL are generally considered to be more serious. Ultimately, while SSL is older and less secure than TLS, it is still widely used. It is recommended that organizations use TLS whenever possible to ensure the highest level of security.\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, that replaced its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a critical part of ensuring secure communication over the internet. TLS provides a layer of encryption to protect sensitive data, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and other private information exchanged between a website and a user's browser. The use of TLS helps to prevent eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other forms of online threats. In this age of cybercrime, the importance of secure communication cannot be overemphasized, and it is recommended that all web applications and online services use TLS for security purposes. Furthermore, it is crucial to keep the TLS protocol up-to-date to stay ahead of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Deploying TLS is not only good security practice, but it is also a necessary step in privacy protection for users of the internet.\n\nThe POODLE attack is a security vulnerability in the SSL protocol that was discovered by Google in 2014. The exploit allowed attackers to retrieve sensitive information such as cookies, passwords, and credit card numbers, by downgrading the encryption from the current TLS protocol to SSL 3.0. In response to the POODLE attack, Mozilla announced that they would be deprecating SSL 3.0 in their Firefox browser, starting with version 34. This decision was later followed by other major browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. The deprecation of SSL 3.0 is intended to encourage website owners and internet users to migrate to the more secure TLS protocol.\n\nHaving a valid TLS certificate is imperative for a website owner since an expired certificate can cause the user's browser to block access to the website. However, manually renewing a TLS certificate can be a time-consuming and challenging process, which is why automatic certificate renewal is preferred. Let's Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority that supports the implementation of the automatic renewal of TLS certificates. In this vein, Let's Encrypt has provided a guide for implementing automatic renewal of free SSL certificates, which ensures that the certificates are renewed every 90 days without any intervention from the website owner. This guide helps website owners to ensure that their website stays accessible to their site visitors while they focus on other crucial aspects of website management.\n\nHTTPS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an essential technology for establishing a secure and encrypted connection between a web browser and a web server. This protocol online merchants, financial institutions, governments, and individuals rely on to protect sensitive information such as credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, and other private data that might be compromised during the network transmission. To determine the general progress of HTTPS adoption by domains, Google issues a transparency report every year that shows monthly encrypted communication percentages performed across selected regions. Frequently updated reports and transparency on this issue give users the ability to choose services that prioritize safe and secure online communication."
